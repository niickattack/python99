A test case should be able to...

...run completely by itself, without any human input. Unit testing is about automation.
...determine by itself whether the function it is testing has passed or failed, without a human interpreting the results.
...run in isolation, separate from any other test cases (even if they test the same functions). Each test case is an island.
